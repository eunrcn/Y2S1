    "In class, we discussed a number of different uninformed search algorithms. In this problem set, we get some hands-on practice by implementing them to solve some simple puzzles. In particular, we investigate the Missionaries and Cannibals problem and the Pitcher Filling problem.\n",

    "## Missionaries and Cannibals\n",
    "\n",
    "The Missionaries and Cannibals (MnC) problem is a classic river-crossing logic puzzle. It is not difficult to solve this problem by hand when we have 3 Missionaries and 3 Cannibals. However, the solution becomes less obvious when we generalize the problem to *m* Missionaries and *c* Cannibals where *m* and *c* are some positive integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is usually stated as follows: *m* missionaries and *c* cannibals are on the right side of a river, along with a boat that can hold at most 2 people. Your goal is to find a way to get everyone to the other side, without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that location (or the missionaries will get eaten!). You can try it here: https://javalab.org/en/boat_puzzle_en/ to test your understanding of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some important points to note when solving this question:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the number of missionaries is zero, it does not matter how many cannibals there are even though technically they outnumber the number of missionaries. \n",
    "* You need to have at least 1 person in the boat to row the boat from one side of the river to the other. \n",
    "* At all times, both sides of the river AND the boat must have either 0 missionaries or at least as many missionaries as cannibals."
