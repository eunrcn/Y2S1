    "In class, we discussed about logistic regression, and how it can be useful as a classification algorithm. In this problem set, we get some hands-on practice by implementing logistic regression on a Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. Note that for this problem set, you should only be using the scikit-learn (sklearn) library for the last part (Tasks 5.x) on SVM.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is, however, an exception for **Tasks 3.4 and 3.5**. In the pseudo-code for the algorithm required, there is an explicit for loop. Hence, only for these task you may use **a single for/while loop** to iterate for the number of epochs required."

    "Fraudulent credit card transaction is a common phenomenon in many parts of the world and can lead to potentially large amounts of losses for both companies and customers.

If we think about what type of data might be included in the input variables under the given context, we might realize that those input variables are likely to include word descriptions, such as shop name or locations. In this problem set, we don't need to worry about language processing as the data are pre-processed to contain only numeric values."

Using Pandas, we can quickly gain an overview of the type and values of the data stored, distributions of values within the dataset, and even ways to perform sampling.\n",

We want to find the \"maximum-margin hyperplane\" that divides the group of points $x^{(i)}$ for which $y_{i}=1$ from the group of points for which $y_{i}=0$, which is defined so that the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point $x^{(i)}$ from either group is maximized.\n",

    "\n",
    "In particular, the summand term is known as the *hinge loss*. Thus, when $y^{(i)} = 0$, the more negative $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}$ is, the more $Cost_1$ penalises the model. Similarly, $Cost_0$ penalises the model the further $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}$ strays from the negative region. Notice how the cost function aligns with the goal of the hypothesis function?\n",
