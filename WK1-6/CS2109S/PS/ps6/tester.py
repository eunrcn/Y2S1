# Define your loss function (you mentioned "get_loss(model)", so I assume you have a custom loss function)
# You need to specify the loss function based on your task.

# Perform training or optimization to adjust the model's parameters to reduce the loss below 1
# You can use an optimization algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient descent) and a dataset with known labels for this purpose.

# Continue training the model until you achieve a loss less than 1
