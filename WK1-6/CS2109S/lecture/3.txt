uniform cost search at one time explore path cost of certain cost

greedy bfs dont consider cost so far
a star search is summation of cost so far and heuristic

a star search only optimal if admissible heuristic
heuristic less than or equal to true cost, dont be over estimation
 

The minimax algorithm is optimal against optimal MIN players, 
but not against non-optimal MIN players

alpha more than or equals to beta then that value will be pruned
min means beta will be changed
max mins alpha changed
