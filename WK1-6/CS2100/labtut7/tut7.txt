1. valid or invalid input
if number of 1 is more than 1, then its valid
if there are 0 or only 1 1, then its invalid
firstly check how many ones there are
a + b + c into a full adder to see carry and sum

can i put carry and sum into the 2 bit adder? into x1 and x0
where to put d and e
e put into y0
put 0 into y1
put d into cin
cannot be d and e into y1 y0 bc they can output 3

put the 3 output into x0 x1 x2
then compare it to 1 to see if its more or less than 1
x3 can be nothing ==0
largest msb is largest subscript

how to abcd + 1 /2 
use a 4 bit adder to plus one 
to shift right by 1 we can put EFGH in the output

but since its a adder cannot shift by 1 value
if D is 0, ABC = FGH
if D is 1, FGH = ABC + 1
draw out truth table and visualise to spot the pattern

4221 to 8421
the pattern is PQR + 1 / 2

0PQR 
0WXY
into a1h since Add-1-then-Half


----------------------------------------------------------
2. 

4221 to 8421
the pattern is PQR + 1 / 2

0PQR 
0WXY
into a1h since Add-1-then-Half


----------------------------------------------------------
3. 
given 4 bit number
output 51xA + (20x(B%2)) = 122
each digit will have their own representation

5xA
has 8 bits bc 4 bit per digit
whenever multiply by 5 will have something that ends with 5
2nd digit is either 5 or 0
if a0 is 1 then 2nd digit will be 5 == 0101
can hook up a0 to 2nd digit

5x10 x A + A 
to + A just hook up a3a2a1a0 to f3f2f1f0

20 x b0 
2 x b0 shift left by 1

can redo if uw

----------------------------------------------------------
4. 
a. 
compare abcd to 11
take when x>y = 1

b. 
0 6 9 15
draw out truth table
if abc is a palindrome then G = 1
can read from front and back

so compare
AB == DC if equal then its G 

c. 
draw truth table
if B and C equal then output a 1

d. 
when d = 1 then z = 1
but exclude 15 = 1111 bc z is 0
so need to know how to exclude
abcd compare with 1111 if abcd is less then z 
exclude all those where D is 0 
compare abcd to dddd
